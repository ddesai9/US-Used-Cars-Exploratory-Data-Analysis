# Exploratory Data Analysis of 3+ Million used cars Dataset

Exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.
John Tukey defined data analysis in 1961 as: "Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.

*	Analyzed 3 million+ US Used Cars containing 66 columns using Pandas 
*	Created visualizations (scatter plots, geo heatmaps, pie charts, etc.) using Seaborn, Plotly and Folium
*	Discovered insights and made statistical inferences about data, using functions and graphs

### Outline

* Downloading a dataset from an online source.
* Data preparation and cleaning
* Open-ended exploratory analysis and visualization.
* Asking and answering interesting questions.
* summarizing inferences and conclusion.
